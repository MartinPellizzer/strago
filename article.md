# Exposing Subtle Workplace Bullying: 27 Signs To Watch Out

## 1. Constant criticism of your work or performance, often in front of others
Constant criticism of your work or performance, especially when it happens in front of others, can be a major source of frustration and stress in the workplace. It's like being put on blast for every little mistake or imperfection, and it can make you feel like you're constantly walking on eggshells.

Imagine this: You're in a meeting, and your boss decides to call out a mistake you made in front of everyone. Or, you're working on a project, and a colleague decides to mock your approach and belittle your ideas. Maybe you're even receiving vague or unhelpful feedback that leaves you feeling confused and frustrated.

These are all examples of constant criticism that can wear you down over time. It can make you feel like you're not good enough, or like you're constantly falling short of expectations. And when it happens in front of others, it can be even more embarrassing and demoralizing.

But here's the thing: constant criticism is not okay. It's a form of workplace bullying that can lead to decreased job satisfaction, decreased productivity, and even mental health problems like anxiety and depression. And you don't have to put up with it.

## 2. Ignoring or excluding you from team activities or meetings
Ignoring or excluding you from team activities or meetings is not only unprofessional, it's a form of workplace bullying that can make you feel isolated and unvalued. It's like being left out in the cold while everyone else gets to enjoy the warmth of the team dynamic.

Here are a few examples of how this kind of behavior might look in the workplace: You're not invited to a team lunch or happy hour, even though everyone else is going. You're not included in an important email chain or meeting, even though you're a key player on the project. Or, you're simply ignored when you try to contribute to a conversation or share your ideas.

When this kind of exclusion happens repeatedly, it can feel like a deliberate attempt to push you out of the team or undermine your contributions. And it's not just hurtful - it's also bad for business. Excluding team members from important discussions or decisions can lead to missed opportunities and decreased productivity.

## 3. Undermining your work by providing incomplete or inaccurate information
Inaccurate or incomplete information can be like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode in your face. Imagine spending hours or even days working on a project only to realize that some critical information was missing, or worse, incorrect. Not only does this waste time and resources, but it can also lead to serious consequences such as missed deadlines, unhappy clients, and even lawsuits.

This kind of situation is all too common in the workplace, where employees may unintentionally undermine their own work by failing to provide accurate or complete information. For example, a salesperson might promise a client a certain product feature without confirming with the product team whether it is actually possible. Or, a marketing team might publish an advertisement with incorrect pricing information, leading to customer confusion and frustration.

Even small errors in information can have a big impact. For instance, a missing decimal point in a financial report can result in significant financial losses. Similarly, incomplete information in a medical chart can put patients at risk.

Inaccurate or incomplete information can also harm team dynamics. When employees don't communicate effectively or provide the necessary information to their colleagues, it can create a sense of mistrust and frustration. Team members may feel like they are constantly chasing down missing information or second-guessing the accuracy of what they are given.

## 4. Giving you impossible deadlines or assigning you tasks outside of your skill set
It's a familiar feeling for many employees: the sinking sensation in your stomach when your boss assigns you a task that seems impossible to complete in the given timeframe or asks you to do something outside of your skill set. This kind of pressure can be frustrating and demotivating, and it can lead to burnout and high turnover rates in the workplace.

For example, a graphic designer may be asked to create a complex website from scratch, despite having no coding experience. A sales representative may be given a sales target that is impossibly high, with no additional resources or support to help them achieve it. A project manager may be given an unrealistic deadline to complete a project, with no consideration for the complexity of the work involved.

When employees are given tasks that are outside of their skill set or are impossible to complete in the given timeframe, it can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and self-doubt. They may feel like they are set up to fail and that their employer does not value their expertise or abilities.

In addition, impossible deadlines and unrealistic tasks can lead to a culture of overwork and burnout. Employees may feel like they have no choice but to work long hours, sacrifice their personal time, and neglect their well-being in order to meet these expectations.

## 5. Micromanaging your work to an extreme degree
Micromanaging can feel like a suffocating presence in the workplace. It's the feeling of being constantly monitored and scrutinized, with little to no autonomy over your work. This extreme level of control can be frustrating and demoralizing for employees, leading to low morale and high turnover rates.

For example, a manager may insist on reviewing every email an employee sends, or demand to be copied on every communication with clients. A supervisor may require daily check-ins or demand to be notified of every minor decision. In extreme cases, micromanagers may even stand over employees' shoulders while they work, monitoring their every move.

Micromanagement can be particularly harmful because it undermines employees' sense of ownership and agency over their work. When they are not given the space to make decisions and take ownership of their work, they may feel like they are not valued or trusted by their employer.

In addition, micromanagement can lead to a culture of fear and mistrust. Employees may feel like they are being watched constantly, leading to a lack of creativity, risk-taking, and innovation. This can be detrimental to the long-term success of a company, as it stifles the very qualities that drive growth and progress.

## 6. Making negative or dismissive comments about your ideas or suggestions
Negative or dismissive comments about your ideas or suggestions can be incredibly demoralizing in the workplace. 

You've likely been in a meeting where you share a suggestion or idea, only to be met with eye-rolls, sighs, or outright criticism. These responses can make you feel small, embarrassed, and less likely to contribute in the future. Unfortunately, this behavior is all too common in some workplaces, and it can have a lasting impact on employees.

Consider the following examples:

- You share a new idea for a project, and a colleague responds with, "That's not going to work. We've tried that before, and it failed."
- You suggest a different approach to a problem, and your manager responds with, "We've been doing it this way for years. Why would we change now?"
- You propose a creative solution to a challenge, and a team member responds with, "That's ridiculous. We can't do that."

These types of negative or dismissive comments shut down conversation and discourage collaboration. They suggest that your ideas aren't valuable and that your contributions don't matter. Over time, this can lead to decreased motivation, disengagement, and even turnover.

As an employer, it's important to create a culture where all ideas are welcome and encouraged. This means actively listening to your employees, valuing their contributions, and giving constructive feedback. If someone does make a negative or dismissive comment, it's important to address it directly and encourage them to offer a more constructive response in the future.

Remember, your employees are your greatest asset, and their ideas and suggestions can help your business thrive. Don't let negativity and dismissiveness stand in the way of progress and success.

## 7. Withholding important information that you need to perform your job effectively
Withholding important information that you need to perform your job is like driving a car blindfolded, and it's a practice that can lead to serious consequences. 

As an employee, you rely on your colleagues and superiors to share crucial information that can impact your work performance and decision-making. When that information is withheld, it can create feelings of frustration, confusion, and helplessness. 

Here are a few examples of how withholding information can negatively affect employees:

- A manager fails to inform their team of changes to a project's deadline, resulting in missed deadlines, rushed work, and a decrease in the quality of work produced.
- An employee is not provided with essential details about a new client, which could lead to a disastrous first impression and damage to the company's reputation.
- A coworker doesn't share critical information about a software program, resulting in wasted time and effort on the employee's part and the need for additional training.
- A supervisor fails to communicate important safety procedures, putting employees at risk of injury or harm.

When information is intentionally withheld, it can create a toxic work environment where trust and collaboration suffer. Employees deserve transparency and honesty from their colleagues and superiors to perform their jobs effectively. So if you're in a position of power, make sure you're providing your team with all the information they need to succeed. 

And if you're an employee, don't be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself when crucial information is being withheld.

## 8. Spreading rumors or gossip about you in the workplace
"Rumors are like wildfires - they can spread quickly and cause immense damage, especially when it comes to workplace gossip."

There's nothing worse than hearing that your coworkers are spreading rumors or gossip about you behind your back. Not only is it hurtful, but it can also damage your reputation and career prospects. 

Here are a few examples of how rumors and gossip can negatively impact your workplace:

- Missed promotions: If false rumors are spread about you, it could lead to missed opportunities for promotions or advancements in your career. It's important to maintain a good reputation in the workplace to ensure that you're seen as a valuable asset to the team.
- Negative work environment: Gossip and rumors can create a toxic work environment that's filled with drama and tension. This can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety, making it difficult to focus on work and achieve your goals.
- Loss of trust: Once rumors start to spread, it can be difficult to know who to trust. This can damage your relationships with colleagues and create a sense of isolation in the workplace.
- Legal implications: If the rumors being spread about you are false and damaging to your reputation, you may have legal grounds to take action against the person spreading them.

It's important to remember that rumors and gossip are never okay, no matter how harmless they may seem. If you find yourself being the subject of workplace gossip, speak up and address the issue head-on. It's important to protect your reputation and maintain a positive work environment for yourself and your colleagues.
