# Exposing Subtle Workplace Bullying: 27 Signs To Watch Out

## 1. Constant criticism of your work or performance, often in front of others
Receiving constant criticism for your work or performance, especially in front of others, can be incredibly frustrating and demoralizing. It's tough to stay motivated when you're constantly being told that you're not good enough.

While it's important for managers and supervisors to offer feedback and help employees improve, there is a fine line between constructive criticism and negativity. Here are some examples of what this might look like:

- Your boss interrupts a team meeting to point out all the flaws in your latest project.
- A coworker makes snide comments about everything you do during group projects.
- Your supervisor sends multiple emails throughout the day criticizing every little mistake you make.
- During an annual review, your manager only focuses on what went wrong instead of recognizing any accomplishments.
- In a brainstorming session, every idea you suggest is shot down immediately without explanation.

Such constant criticism can easily make us disengaged from our work or even feel defeated entirely - we may just stop putting effort into tasks altogether.

As employees, we deserve respect from those who manage us; they should motivate us through encouragement rather than always putting us down at every turn.

## 2. Ignoring or excluding you from team activities or meetings
Feeling excluded or ignored within a team can be incredibly frustrating and demoralizing. It's tough to feel motivated when you're constantly left out of important meetings or activities, especially when it affects your ability to contribute effectively.

Unfortunately, some managers and co-workers engage in this type of behavior intentionally or unintentionally. Here are some examples:

- You notice that everyone on the team has been invited to a happy hour after work except for you.
- Your boss holds weekly meetings but never invites you even though they relate directly to your job responsibilities.
- During a brainstorming session, several coworkers talk over you and ignore your suggestions completely.
- Your colleagues often make jokes about events that happened during team outings that you weren't invited to attend.
- A coworker purposely excludes you from email chains related to projects that involve your expertise.

Being left out like this can easily lead us to feeling unmotivated and disengaged from our work altogether - why put in the effort if we don't get any recognition?

As employees, it is vital for us all to feel included in our teams so we can collaborate effectively towards common goals; those who exclude their teammates are doing nothing but harm morale and productivity alike!

## 3. Undermining your work by providing incomplete or inaccurate information
It can be incredibly frustrating and demotivating when someone else undermines the quality of your work by providing incomplete or inaccurate information. It makes you feel like a failure, even though it's not necessarily your fault.

Have you ever had to deal with this type of behavior before? Perhaps a coworker gave you incorrect data for a report or insisted on using outdated procedures despite knowing better. Or maybe during team meetings, someone frequently shared false information that threw everyone off track.

Here are some other examples:

- A colleague refuses to share crucial details about their part of the project until the last minute.
- Your boss insists on taking credit for your ideas without giving proper recognition.
- Someone presents themselves as an expert in a field but provides misleading advice that causes more problems than solutions.
- A coworker gives vague instructions or withholds important context, leading to confusion and delays in completing tasks.
- During brainstorming sessions, one person shoots down every idea without offering constructive feedback.

When our coworkers provide us with insufficient or incorrect information, we're almost set up for failure from the outset - which is why accuracy and completeness are so vital! Those who undermine our efforts ultimately hurt morale and productivity alike, making it difficult to stay motivated at work

## 4. Giving you impossible deadlines or assigning you tasks outside of your skill set
Being given impossible deadlines or tasks that are outside your skill set is like being set up to fail. It's frustrating, demoralizing, and completely unfair."

Have you ever been in a situation where you're assigned a task that feels almost impossible to complete within the given timeframe? Or perhaps someone has asked you to do something that's entirely outside of your area of expertise?

Here are some examples:

- Your boss demands that you finish an entire project over the weekend despite it being intended for a team of people.
- You're asked to give a presentation on a topic with which you have zero experience.
- A colleague assigns you work that requires specialized knowledge or skills without providing any training or guidance.
- Your supervisor insists on adding new requirements to an assignment at the last minute but still expects it submitted by its original due date.
- Someone else takes credit for your work after assigning tasks well beyond what was reasonable.

When we're given unrealistic timelines or tasks outside our areas of expertise, it can be hard not to feel defeated before we even begin - especially when there's no support offered along the way!

## 5. Micromanaging your work to an extreme degree
Stop it. Just stop micromanaging your employees or colleagues to the point of exhaustion and frustration. Not only is it counterproductive, but it also creates a toxic work environment that damages morale, motivation, and creativity.

Here are five examples of micromanagement gone wrong:

- Constantly checking in on progress without giving enough time to complete tasks.
- Dictating every aspect of a project without leaving room for collaboration or input from team members.
- Hovering over someone's shoulder while they work.
- Criticizing minor details instead of focusing on the big picture.
- Refusing to delegate tasks because "no one else can do it right."

When you micromanage excessively, you undermine trust in your abilities as a leader and create unnecessary stress for everyone involved.

As leaders, we need to empower our teams by setting clear expectations and providing support when needed without suffocating them with constant supervision.

In conclusion, remember that trust is essential in any workplace relationship; if you're not willing to give your team members autonomy and space to grow professionally, then maybe you're not cut out for leadership after all.

## 6. Making negative or dismissive comments about your ideas or suggestions
Have you ever shared an idea or suggestion, only to have it shot down with negative or dismissive comments? It's frustrating and demotivating when people don't take your ideas seriously. Here are some examples of such comments:

- "That won't work because..."
- "We've never done that before."
- "I don't think we have the resources for that."
- "Let's stick to what we know works."
- "That's not a priority right now."

These comments can make you feel undervalued and unappreciated. However, it's essential to remember that feedback is necessary for growth and improvement.

Instead of getting defensive, try to understand why someone may be dismissing your idea or suggestion. Are they concerned about the feasibility? Do they lack information on the topic? Or do they have personal biases?

Use their feedback constructively by asking questions and seeking clarification on their objections. This way, you can improve your proposal while also addressing any concerns raised.

In conclusion, receiving negative or dismissive comments on your ideas can be discouraging but use them as an opportunity for growth instead of letting them bring you down!

## 7. Withholding important information that you need to perform your job effectively
As an employee, it's infuriating when someone holds back essential information that you need to do your job effectively. Here are a few examples:

- A coworker neglects to share critical feedback on a collaborative project with clients.
- Your boss keeps changes in leadership structure under wraps.
- You only find out about significant deadlines after they've already come and gone.

So what can you do if vital information is being withheld from you? Take these actionable steps:

- Clarify expectations upfront by asking questions and getting specific details regarding deadlines and deliverables.
- Foster open communication within your team by creating channels for employees to speak up if they feel like they're missing something essential or not receiving enough information.
- Follow up regularly via email or chat to ensure everyone stays updated throughout projects or assignments.

Remember that clear communication is fundamental when working towards shared goals in the workplace! By taking charge, asking questions, and fostering open dialogue between team members, we can avoid misunderstandings while increasing productivity and morale overall!

In conclusion, don't let the frustration of withheld information hold you back. Proactively seek out answers, encourage open communication, and take steps towards achieving success together as a team!

## 8. Spreading rumors or gossip about you in the workplace
"Rumors are like wildfires - they can spread quickly and cause immense damage, especially when it comes to workplace gossip."

There's nothing worse than hearing that your coworkers are spreading rumors or gossip about you behind your back. Not only is it hurtful, but it can also damage your reputation and career prospects. 

Here are a few examples of how rumors and gossip can negatively impact your workplace:

- Missed promotions: If false rumors are spread about you, it could lead to missed opportunities for promotions or advancements in your career. It's important to maintain a good reputation in the workplace to ensure that you're seen as a valuable asset to the team.
- Negative work environment: Gossip and rumors can create a toxic work environment that's filled with drama and tension. This can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety, making it difficult to focus on work and achieve your goals.
- Loss of trust: Once rumors start to spread, it can be difficult to know who to trust. This can damage your relationships with colleagues and create a sense of isolation in the workplace.
- Legal implications: If the rumors being spread about you are false and damaging to your reputation, you may have legal grounds to take action against the person spreading them.

It's important to remember that rumors and gossip are never okay, no matter how harmless they may seem. If you find yourself being the subject of workplace gossip, speak up and address the issue head-on. It's important to protect your reputation and maintain a positive work environment for yourself and your colleagues.
