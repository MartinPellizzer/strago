<h2 id="1">1. Constant criticism of your work or performance, often in front of others</h2><img class="post-img"

<p>Receiving constant criticism for your work or performance, especially in front of others, can be incredibly
    frustrating and demoralizing. It's tough to stay motivated when you're constantly being told that you're not good
    enough.</p>
<p>While it's important for managers and supervisors to offer feedback and help employees improve, there is a fine line
    between constructive criticism and negativity. Here are some examples of what this might look like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your boss interrupts a team meeting to point out all the flaws in your latest project.</li>
    <li>A coworker makes snide comments about everything you do during group projects.</li>
    <li>Your supervisor sends multiple emails throughout the day criticizing every little mistake you make.</li>
    <li>During an annual review, your manager only focuses on what went wrong instead of recognizing any
        accomplishments.</li>
    <li>In a brainstorming session, every idea you suggest is shot down immediately without explanation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such constant criticism can easily make us disengaged from our work or even feel defeated entirely - we may just stop
    putting effort into tasks altogether.</p>
<p>As employees, we deserve respect from those who manage us; they should motivate us through encouragement rather than
    always putting us down at every turn.</p>
<h2 id="2">2. Ignoring or excluding you from team activities or meetings</h2><img class="post-img"
    alt="2. Ignoring or excluding you from team activities or meetings"
    title="2. Ignoring or excluding you from team activities or meetings"
    src="./assets/subtle-workplace-bullying/ignoring-or-excluding-you-from-team-activities-or-meetings.jpg" />
<p>Feeling excluded or ignored within a team can be incredibly frustrating and demoralizing. It's tough to feel
    motivated when you're constantly left out of important meetings or activities, especially when it affects your
    ability to contribute effectively.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some managers and co-workers engage in this type of behavior intentionally or unintentionally. Here
    are some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You notice that everyone on the team has been invited to a happy hour after work except for you.</li>
    <li>Your boss holds weekly meetings but never invites you even though they relate directly to your job
        responsibilities.</li>
    <li>During a brainstorming session, several coworkers talk over you and ignore your suggestions completely.</li>
    <li>Your colleagues often make jokes about events that happened during team outings that you weren't invited to
        attend.</li>
    <li>A coworker purposely excludes you from email chains related to projects that involve your expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being left out like this can easily lead us to feeling unmotivated and disengaged from our work altogether - why put
    in the effort if we don't get any recognition?</p>
<p>As employees, it is vital for us all to feel included in our teams so we can collaborate effectively towards common
    goals; those who exclude their teammates are doing nothing but harm morale and productivity alike!</p>
<h2 id="3">3. Undermining your work by providing incomplete or inaccurate information</h2><img class="post-img"
    alt="3. Undermining your work by providing incomplete or inaccurate information"
    title="3. Undermining your work by providing incomplete or inaccurate information"
    src="./assets/subtle-workplace-bullying/undermining-your-work-by-providing-incomplete-or-inaccurate-information.jpg" />
<p>It can be incredibly frustrating and demotivating when someone else undermines the quality of your work by providing
    incomplete or inaccurate information. It makes you feel like a failure, even though it's not necessarily your fault.
</p>
<p>Have you ever had to deal with this type of behavior before? Perhaps a coworker gave you incorrect data for a report
    or insisted on using outdated procedures despite knowing better. Or maybe during team meetings, someone frequently
    shared false information that threw everyone off track.</p>
<p>Here are some other examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A colleague refuses to share crucial details about their part of the project until the last minute.</li>
    <li>Your boss insists on taking credit for your ideas without giving proper recognition.</li>
    <li>Someone presents themselves as an expert in a field but provides misleading advice that causes more problems
        than solutions.</li>
    <li>A coworker gives vague instructions or withholds important context, leading to confusion and delays in
        completing tasks.</li>
    <li>During brainstorming sessions, one person shoots down every idea without offering constructive feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>When our coworkers provide us with insufficient or incorrect information, we're almost set up for failure from the
    outset - which is why accuracy and completeness are so vital! Those who undermine our efforts ultimately hurt morale
    and productivity alike, making it difficult to stay motivated at work</p>
<h2 id="4">4. Giving you impossible deadlines or assigning you tasks outside of your skill set</h2><img class="post-img"
    alt="4. Giving you impossible deadlines or assigning you tasks outside of your skill set"
    title="4. Giving you impossible deadlines or assigning you tasks outside of your skill set"
    src="./assets/subtle-workplace-bullying/giving-you-impossible-deadlines-or-assigning-you-tasks-outside-of-your-skill-set.jpg" />
<p>Being given impossible deadlines or tasks that are outside your skill set is like being set up to fail. It's
    frustrating, demoralizing, and completely unfair."</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you're assigned a task that feels almost impossible to complete within the
    given timeframe? Or perhaps someone has asked you to do something that's entirely outside of your area of expertise?
</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your boss demands that you finish an entire project over the weekend despite it being intended for a team of
        people.</li>
    <li>You're asked to give a presentation on a topic with which you have zero experience.</li>
    <li>A colleague assigns you work that requires specialized knowledge or skills without providing any training or
        guidance.</li>
    <li>Your supervisor insists on adding new requirements to an assignment at the last minute but still expects it
        submitted by its original due date.</li>
    <li>Someone else takes credit for your work after assigning tasks well beyond what was reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we're given unrealistic timelines or tasks outside our areas of expertise, it can be hard not to feel defeated
    before we even begin - especially when there's no support offered along the way!</p>
<h2 id="5">5. Micromanaging your work to an extreme degree</h2><img class="post-img"
    alt="5. Micromanaging your work to an extreme degree" title="5. Micromanaging your work to an extreme degree"
    src="./assets/subtle-workplace-bullying/micromanaging-your-work-to-an-extreme-degree.jpg" />
<p>Stop it. Just stop micromanaging your employees or colleagues to the point of exhaustion and frustration. Not only is
    it counterproductive, but it also creates a toxic work environment that damages morale, motivation, and creativity.
</p>
<p>Here are five examples of micromanagement gone wrong:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Constantly checking in on progress without giving enough time to complete tasks.</li>
    <li>Dictating every aspect of a project without leaving room for collaboration or input from team members.</li>
    <li>Hovering over someone's shoulder while they work.</li>
    <li>Criticizing minor details instead of focusing on the big picture.</li>
    <li>Refusing to delegate tasks because "no one else can do it right."</li>
</ul>
<p>When you micromanage excessively, you undermine trust in your abilities as a leader and create unnecessary stress for
    everyone involved.</p>
<p>As leaders, we need to empower our teams by setting clear expectations and providing support when needed without
    suffocating them with constant supervision.</p>
<p>In conclusion, remember that trust is essential in any workplace relationship; if you're not willing to give your
    team members autonomy and space to grow professionally, then maybe you're not cut out for leadership after all.</p>
<h2 id="6">6. Making negative or dismissive comments about your ideas or suggestions</h2><img class="post-img"

    title="6. Making negative or dismissive comments about your ideas or suggestions"
    src="./assets/subtle-workplace-bullying/making-negative-or-dismissive-comments-about-your-ideas-or-suggestions.jpg" />
<p>Have you ever shared an idea or suggestion, only to have it shot down with negative or dismissive comments? It's
    frustrating and demotivating when people don't take your ideas seriously. Here are some examples of such comments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>"That won't work because..."</li>
    <li>"We've never done that before."</li>
    <li>"I don't think we have the resources for that."</li>
    <li>"Let's stick to what we know works."</li>
    <li>"That's not a priority right now."</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments can make you feel undervalued and unappreciated. However, it's essential to remember that feedback is
    necessary for growth and improvement.</p>
<p>Instead of getting defensive, try to understand why someone may be dismissing your idea or suggestion. Are they
    concerned about the feasibility? Do they lack information on the topic? Or do they have personal biases?</p>
<p>Use their feedback constructively by asking questions and seeking clarification on their objections. This way, you
    can improve your proposal while also addressing any concerns raised.</p>
<p>In conclusion, receiving negative or dismissive comments on your ideas can be discouraging but use them as an
    opportunity for growth instead of letting them bring you down!</p>
<h2 id="7">7. Withholding important information that you need to perform your job effectively</h2><img class="post-img"
    alt="7. Withholding important information that you need to perform your job effectively"
    title="7. Withholding important information that you need to perform your job effectively"
    src="./assets/subtle-workplace-bullying/withholding-important-information-that-you-need-to-perform-your-job-effectively.jpg" />
<p>As an employee, it's infuriating when someone holds back essential information that you need to do your job
    effectively. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A coworker neglects to share critical feedback on a collaborative project with clients.</li>
    <li>Your boss keeps changes in leadership structure under wraps.</li>
    <li>You only find out about significant deadlines after they've already come and gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what can you do if vital information is being withheld from you? Take these actionable steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clarify expectations upfront by asking questions and getting specific details regarding deadlines and
        deliverables.</li>
    <li>Foster open communication within your team by creating channels for employees to speak up if they feel like
        they're missing something essential or not receiving enough information.</li>
    <li>Follow up regularly via email or chat to ensure everyone stays updated throughout projects or assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that clear communication is fundamental when working towards shared goals in the workplace! By taking
    charge, asking questions, and fostering open dialogue between team members, we can avoid misunderstandings while
    increasing productivity and morale overall!</p>
<p>In conclusion, don't let the frustration of withheld information hold you back. Proactively seek out answers,
    encourage open communication, and take steps towards achieving success together as a team!</p>
